    Bunbury is a tasteful town
      Beside a syrup sea,
    Where sponge cake fish and waffle whales
      Disport themselves in glee.

    Bunbury’s streets are good to eat
      Of that make no mistake,
    For Bunbury’s streets are made, you know,
      Of finest marble cake.

    Its fences are of pie crust
      And its houses built of buns,
    With frosted roofs and raisins
      On the most important ones.

    Bunbury has fine doughnut trees
      Beside a chocolate fountain,
    And just outside the town you’ll find
      A giant layer cake mountain.

    Its people are too cunning
      And too sweet for any use;
    There’s spry Pop Over, Johnny Cake
      And dainty Charlotte Russe.

    The moon’s a muffin, and the sun
      A hot cake warm and mellow.
    Its gentle rays make Bunbury folk
      A tempting brownish yellow!

    And when it snows, marshmallow
      Covers everything with icing—
    The houses, and the people, too,
      Look even more enticing.

    Bunbury’s folk oft gather round
      Ye Coffee Ring, and tell
    The news about young Johnny Cake—
      Who’s courting Patty Shell!

                             [Illustration]

    Bunbury’s vaults are filled with gems
      For Hun Bun, the bun boy king.
    He has gems to burn (but doesn’t)
      Burnt gems are not the thing.

    The reason why this little town
      So gay and sweet and nice is
    Because each cake and cooky there
      Was raised on Dr. Price’s!

    Now one day as the cooky clock
      In taffy tower tolled,
    Flap Jack, the King’s own messenger
      Into the castle rolled.

    “Your Bunship!” puffed the little Jack,
      “I bring surprising news!
    There is a little lad near here
      Too skinny for his shoes.

    “He will not eat his breakfast
      And he will not eat his lunch.
    He’s lost his taste for baseball
      And completely lost his punch!”

                             [Illustration]

------------------------------------------------------------------------


                               FLAP JACKS

                       (_see illustration below_)

    1¾ cups flour
    ½ teaspoon salt
    3 teaspoons Dr. Price’s Baking Powder
    2 eggs
    1½ cups milk
    1 tablespoon shortening

Sift dry ingredients together; add beaten eggs, milk and melted
shortening; mix well. Bake on hot, slightly greased griddle until
bubbles appear; turn over quickly and brown other side. Serve
immediately on hot plate with plenty of butter and syrup or butter and
cinnamon mixed with sugar.

Makes 24 flap jacks.


                          FLAP JACKS WITH RICE

    1 cup boiled rice
    1 cup milk
    1 tablespoon melted shortening
    ½ teaspoon salt
    1 egg
    1 cup flour
    4 teaspoons Dr. Price’s Baking Powder

Mix rice, milk, shortening, salt and well-beaten egg; stir in flour and
baking powder which have been sifted together; mix well, adding more
milk if necessary to make a soft batter. Bake on hot, slightly greased
griddle until bubbles appear; turn over quickly and brown other side.
Serve immediately on hot plate with plenty of butter and syrup or butter
and cinnamon mixed with sugar.

Makes 24 flap jacks.

    “What?” spluttered Hun Bun, pushing back
      His sparkling candy crown;
    “Ho! fetch my dog! Ho! fetch my cane!
      I’ll catch a train to town!”

    And when his cane and dog were fetched
      He hopped aboard the train,
    And in a way I scarce can guess
      And even less explain

    Arrived at little Billy’s house.
      He found the boy at tea.
    “Hello!” cried Hun Bun, “Howdy-do!”
      And likewise, “Howdy-de!”

    Then Hun Bun’s dog began to bark,
      You’ve heard of him, perhaps?
    He’s full of ginger and of spice
      His name is Ginger Snaps.

    “Why, who are you?” gasped Billy
      Nearly falling in his plate.
    “I’m Hun Bun!” smiled the little chap,
      “The Cooky Potentate.”

    “Go on and eat your supper, boy,
      ’Twill make you strong and fat,
    And fit to hit a punching bag
      Or swing a baseball bat!”

    “Not hungry” sighed the little lad
      And scowled upon his meat,
    And frowned into his glass of milk,
      “There’s nothing fit to eat.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------


                               DOUGHNUTS

These doughnuts are very wholesome and excellent for children. They do
not contain any shortening and should be fried very carefully in fat at
just the right temperature so that no grease will be absorbed. They can
be served plain or sprinkled with powdered sugar after they have
thoroughly drained and cooled.

    2 eggs
    ¾ cup milk
    2¾ cups flour
    1 teaspoon salt
    4 teaspoons Dr. Price’s Baking Powder
    1 cup sugar
    ½ teaspoon nutmeg or cinnamon

Save ⅓ cup of measured flour for board. Beat eggs until light; add milk,
then add this liquid to the dry ingredients which have been sifted well
together. Roll out ¼ inch thick on slightly floured board and fry in
deep fat (365°-375°). Drain well on unglazed paper. Sprinkle with
powdered sugar.

Makes 30 doughnuts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    “Dear me” mused Hun Bun, while the pup
      Licked Billy on the ear,
    “A boy as thin as you could not
      Be President I fear.”

    And hopping on the table
      He began to walk around,
    He peered into each plate and dish,
      Then even Hun Bun frowned.

    And leaning on his pep’mint cane
      And looking really hurt,
    The bun boy King called dolefully,
      “Why, where is the dessert?”

    In rage he shook his candy cane,
      As will such angry kings;
    And roared, “It’s plain to see your fare
      Lacks most essential things.

    “No cakes, no cookies and no buns,
      No biscuits—not a tart!
    None of the things real fellows like,
      Why Bill, it breaks my heart!

    “It seems your mother does not know
      What youngsters like to eat,
    It surely is high time, I think,
      That she and I should meet!”

                             SUGAR COOKIES

    ½ cup shortening
    1½ cups sugar
    ¼ cup milk
    2 eggs
    ½ teaspoon grated nutmeg
    1 teaspoon vanilla or grated rind of 1 lemon
    3 to 4 cups flour
    ½ teaspoon salt
    2½ teaspoons Dr. Price’s Baking Powder

Cream shortening and sugar together; add milk to beaten eggs and beat
again; add slowly to creamed shortening and sugar; add flavoring; add 2
cups of measured flour sifted with salt, baking powder and nutmeg; add
enough more flour to roll easily. Roll out thin on floured board; cut
with any fancy-shaped cooky cutter; sprinkle with granulated sugar or
put a raisin or nut in the center of each. Bake about 10 minutes in
moderate oven (380°).

For Chocolate Cookies put aside portion of the dough before adding all
the flour and add 2 tablespoons cocoa to each cup of cooky dough.

Makes 4 dozen cookies.

    Soon, hearing all the rumpus
      Billy’s mother came to see
    To whom her son was talking
      And what all the noise could be.

    When Hun Bun spied her, he remarked
      In accents sharp and biting,
    “No wonder that your boy won’t eat,
      His food’s so uninviting.

    “Your son wants cookies, buns and cake,
      And other things that mothers make.”
    Bill’s mother, looking apprehensive,
      Remarked, “But cakes are so expensive.”

    “Not so!” quoth Hun Bun drawing forth
      A brightly colored book,
    “Use Dr. Price’s Baking Powder,
      Hereafter when you cook!”

    Then Hun Bun gaily doffed his crown
      And with a bow quite comical,
    He told her, “You will find it good
      And very economical.

    “But now we must depart and so
      We’ll bid you a good-night,
    For Bill and I are going to try
      To find his appetite.”

                           BUTTERSCOTCH CURLS

                       (_see illustration below_)

    2 cups flour
    4 teaspoons Dr. Price’s Baking Powder
    ⅔ teaspoon salt
    4 tablespoons shortening
    ⅔ cup milk
    Butter
    Brown sugar

Sift dry ingredients; add shortening, mixing it in with a fork (if
liquid shortening is used, add with milk). Add milk to make a fairly
soft dough. Knead slightly and roll out ¼ inch thick. Spread well with
creamed butter and brown sugar. Roll up as for jelly roll; cut in 1-inch
pieces. Stand these on end in well-buttered gem pans or in small greased
muffin rings and bake in a hot oven (425°) about 15 minutes. Makes 12
rolls or 22 if baked in small rings.


                             PEANUT COOKIES

    1 cup flour
    ½ teaspoon salt
    2 teaspoons Dr. Price’s Baking Powder
    2 tablespoons shortening
    1 cup chopped peanuts
    ½ cup sugar
    ¼ cup milk
    1 egg
    1 teaspoon lemon juice

Sift dry ingredients together. Add melted shortening to beaten egg. Add
milk and lemon juice, and mix well with the dry ingredients to make soft
dough. Add peanuts; mix well and drop with teaspoon on greased pan. Bake
in moderate oven (400°) about 20 minutes. This recipe makes about four
dozen small cookies and requires 1 quart of peanuts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    And while the puzzled lady
      Grasped the cook book in surprise,
    The Pup and Bill and Hun Bun
      Disappeared before her eyes.

    Next instant they were on a train
      And hieing in a hurry
    Across a golden cornbread plain
      To little Hun’s Bunbury.

    The engine on its lic’rice rails
      Cream puffed along so fast
    The pep’mint poles and chocolate cows
      Went simply whizzing past!

    And when they reached the station
      All the tasty cakes and tarts
    Were out to welcome Billy,
      Bless their little sugar hearts.

    The Royal Bun Band headed
      By a pound cake drummer man,
    Came tooting down the central street
      And after it there ran

    A flock of Scotch and Dutch cakes,
      Twenty cookies and a roll,
    While all the orange icing bells
      Began to peal and toll.

                             [Illustration]

    Soon our Billy was no bigger
      Than a Cooky Man himself;
    For Hun’s magician, Devils Food,
      Had changed him to an elf.

    “We’re going to the circus first,”
      Said Hun Bun in his ear,
    “Where you can see the animals
      And all the freaks, so queer.”

    The little cracker animals
      Cavorted ’round the tent,
    Till the air was full of cracker dust
      And cheers and merriment.

    How Billy laughed, while Ginger barked
      And Hun Bun clapped with glee;
    “Come on now,” cried the mighty king
      “There’s other folk to see.

    “Here’s Captain Jelly Roll who drills
      Our biscuit P’licemen brave,
    But we don’t really need them
      For good cakes like us behave.”

    The more of Bunbury’s sights he saw,
      The hungrier he grew,
    And yet, to eat up Hun Bun’s friends
      Would never, never do.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


                             BISCUIT TARTS

    2 cups flour
    3 teaspoons Dr. Price’s Baking Powder
    ½ teaspoon salt
    1 tablespoon sugar
    1 egg
    2 tablespoons shortening
    ⅓ cup milk

Sift together flour, baking powder, salt and sugar; add well-beaten egg
and melted shortening to milk and add to dry ingredients to make soft
dough. Roll out on floured board, ⅛ inch thick. Cut out with medium-size
biscuit cutter which has been dipped in flour. Then taking a smaller
cutter, cut ½ of these rounds again. Brush the large rounds lightly with
melted butter. Then take the outer rings and lay on top of the large
buttered rounds. Put on greased baking tin. Put a teaspoon of jam in
each tart and bake in hot oven (475°) for about 10 minutes. The small
centers can be brushed with butter and baked in the same manner and
served as little tea biscuits.

Makes 10 tarts with 10 tiny biscuits.

                      _All measurements are level_

    While no one looked he slyly took
      A piece of pie crust fence,
    And next he ate a pretzel gate—
      It tasted just immense!

    They stopped to watch a cake walk
      In the little frosted square
    Where all the best and richest cakes
      Were stepping it for fair.

    The Scotch scones danced the Highland fling,
      The Dutch cakes danced the clog,
    And Hun Bun led the bun ballet
      Assisted by his dog.

    Young Billy felt so gay himself
      He danced with Sally Lunn,
    He never knew a cake walk
      Was such a lot of fun.

    But with every passing minute
      Bill grew hungrier until
    Bunbury’s king was worried!
      “I’m afraid that little Bill

    Will bring this cake walk to an end
      And start a canni-ball,
    He’ll eat my favorite subjects up
      Which wouldn’t do at all.”

    2 eggs
    ⅔ cup milk
    2 cups flour
    ½ teaspoon salt
    3 teaspoons Dr. Price’s Baking Powder
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Cream butter, add sugar slowly; add beaten eggs. Sift flour, salt and
baking powder together; add a little at a time alternately with the milk
to the first mixture; beat thoroughly; add flavoring and bake in greased
small gem pans in a hot oven (425°) about 20 minutes. Cover with plain

    White of 1 egg
    ½ cup currant or other jelly

Put egg white and jelly together into bowl and beat with egg beater or
wire whip until stiff. Spread on tops of cakes.

    He murmured to a tea bun,
      “Though I certainly rejoice
    To see he’s found his appetite,
      Just order my Rolls Royce.”

    Soon up it rolled, a chocolate drop
      Was at the cooky wheel.
    “Jump in,” cried Hun Bun, “It is time
      For us to leave, I feel.

    “Now you may eat the extra tire,”
      (It was a doughnut brown)
    “Oh, thank you, Hun,” cried Billy,
      As they sped from Bunbury town.

    They reached home very quickly
      By the magic route they took,
    And there they found Bill’s mother
      Absorbed in Hun Bun’s book.

    “Here’s Billy,” shouted Hun Bun,
      “With an appetite so hearty
    He gobbled up a fence and gate
      And nearly ate the party!”

    “The things I saw all looked so good
      I longed to eat my fill,
    Oh, mother, how I wish that you
      Could make me some,” cried Bill.

    “I never could,” she started,
      But this speech was not allowed her,
    For Hun Bun cried, “You can if you
      Use Price’s Baking Powder!”

    So saying, Hun gave her a can
      Of bright and sunny yellow.
    “With this you easily can make
      Good things for this young fellow.

    “And Madam, ’stead of coaxing
      Boys and girls to eat, ’tis wiser
    To add a cake or cooky
      As a little appetizer!”

    From the day that he met Hun Bun
      Little Bill began to gain.
    His appetite’s tremendous
      And the reason’s very plain.

    His mother makes him good things
      Of which he eats his fill,
    For everything she puts in them
      Is good for little Bill.

    Dr. Price’s Baking Powder
      And King Hun Bun’s wondrous book
    Have made of Billy’s mother
      An exceedingly good cook.

    He eats his lunch and breakfast
      Each meal he finds a treat.
    The other fellows watch their step
      When Bill comes down the street.

    Cakes like he met in Bunbury
      His mother makes him now
    And if YOU want some too, this book
      Will tell YOUR MOTHER how!

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
